# Tail Recursion

In the lectures, we've seen code for a recursive implementation for computing
the Fibonacci numbers. Make this implementation tail-recursive. I have not
provided a template; depending on how you choose to implement the function, it
will have a different signature. I have also not provided any test code, but you
can base yours on test code from other exercises.

Hint: It may help to have a look at the iterative dynamic programming
implementation. What changes between iterations of the loop?

## Runtime Analysis

Is the asymptotic complexity of tail-recursive Fibonacci different from the
non-tail-recursive version? Why, or why not? Add your answer, including your
reasoning, to this markdown file.

I believe the asymptotic complexity of the tail-recursive Fibonacci function is the same as the non-tail-recursive version. Both of them have a time complexity of $O(2^n)$. The tail-recursion primarily affects the space complexity, not the time complexity. The time complexity of both implementations is detirmined by the number of recursive calls made to calculate the Fibonacci numbers. In both cases, for each value of $n$, the function makes two recursive calls.
